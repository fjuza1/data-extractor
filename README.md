Class GetData - Data Extraction from Services

_getObjectValues: Returns the values of an object as an array. If the input is null or undefined, it returns undefined.

_getObjectKeys: Returns the keys of an object as an array.

_isPrimitive: Checks if a given value is primitive (not an object or null).

_isNotArrayOfObjects: Determines if an array does not contain objects (only primitives or other types).

_getSingleDataTypesFromArrays: Flattens and returns only non-object elements from arrays within the object’s values.

_extractPrimitiveToObject: Extracts primitive properties from an object and returns them as a new object.

_getNestedObjects: Retrieves nested objects within an object’s values, collecting them into a flat array.

_getSimpleObjects: Collects simple objects (non-nested) within an object or array, filtering out arrays of complex objects.

_getValuesAndKeysArray: Combines and returns primitive, nested, and simple objects' keys and values into a consolidated array.



Class ConsolidateData - Data Processing (extends GetData)

_numberDuplicates: Adds a numerical suffix to duplicate items in an array to ensure unique values.

_getDisallowed: Extracts specified disallowed keys and their values from an object.

_removeDisallowed: Removes specified disallowed keys from an object.

_consolidateData: Consolidates and returns an array of unique keys and values from nested data structures.

_getObjectByValue: Searches recursively in an object to find the first key-value pair matching a specified value.

_isSingleObjectType: Checks if each value in an object is of a primitive type (number, boolean, or string).

_renameKeysInComplexObject: Renames keys within complex objects based on nested data, returning them as unique identifiers.

_extractValuesFromArray: Extracts allowed key-value pairs from complex nested objects and arranges them as simple key-value pairs.

_storeKeyValuesToEnv: Stores key-value pairs into an environment variable (or console output) after identifying empty values and numbering duplicates.

These descriptions aim to clarify the purpose and functionality of each function within the context of data extraction and processing.
